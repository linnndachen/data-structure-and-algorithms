    "\n",
    "- Space:\n",
    "    - array-based data structure is a lot more space efficient. The whole stack only requires 1 reference-sized array cell, while in a linked-list, each node has 2 references.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - However, a linked-list can grow and shrink dynamically. Therefore, if the Stack is empty, linked-list can free up the space. Also, dynamic array can run into the memory allocation issues. \n",

    "\n",
    "\"The list Built-in\n",
    "Python’s built-in list type makes a decent stack data structure as it supports push and pop operations in amortized O(1) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s lists are implemented as dynamic arrays internally which means they occasionally need to resize the storage space for elements stored in them whenever they are added or removed. The storage space is allocated more than required, so that not every push or pop requires resizing and you get an amortized O(1) time complexity for these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this makes their performance less consistent than the stable O(1) inserts and deletes provided by a linked list-based implementation. On the other hand, lists provide fast O(1) time random access to elements on the stack which can be an added benefit.\"\n",
